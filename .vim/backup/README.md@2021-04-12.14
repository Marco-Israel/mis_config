## General info
This folder folds configuration files used by openssl tool to generate X509
conform certificates by using. This configuration files are a mix of asn1 syntax
elements and openssl specific syntax elements.

## Folder structure
This folder holds a couple of sup folders:
* The folders with a dotted number are test cases.
* The folder cnf holds the default configuration file.
* ./create-certificates.sh is a script building the certificates. run --help to
    get further information
* ./test-runner.sh is a wrapper to ./create-certificates.sh. When first called
    it sets up the test folder structure. When called again it will execute the
    certificate generation process in the given testcase folder. Run --help for
    more information.
* doc holds some documentation about asn1 or the requirements related to this
    project as also the schemata description files.
* README.md is this file
