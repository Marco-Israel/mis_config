TEST
3.2.2.4_Extension_ExtendedKeyUsage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED SCOPE:
The implementation MUST be modular such that the extension supports proprietary,
custom-defined OIDs in addition to the well-known OIDs.


In addition to 3.2.5.2 Extension ExtKeyUsage:
The absence of the extension represents any key usage.
A lower certificate cannot have more extended key usages than a higher
certificate, only less.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTLIST:

1_invalide_OIDS
Define different psydo OIDs in root and sub configuration files; not used
somewhere else.

2_valid_OIDs_but_not_for_this_project.
Use standard OID shortcut name

3_a_lower_certificate_with_more_extended_key_usages
The absence of the extension represents any key usage.  A lower certificate
cannot have more extended key usages than a higher certificate, only less. To
test this, the sub and subsriber certificates will miss the (have no) extended
keyUsage but the root certificate implements a valid ExtKeyUsage extension.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1_invalide_OIDS

EXPECT:
As mentioned out in the documentation:
The OID "can either be object short names or the dotted numerical form of OIDs.
While any OID can be used only certain values make sense."
In conclusion openssl should generate certificates without notification about
invalid information about OIDs.

RESULT:
TRUE


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2_valid_OIDs_but_not_for_this_project

EXPECT:
Same as above for well known OIDs

RESULT:
TRUE


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3_a_lower_certificate_with_more_extended_key_usages

EXPACT
Because of the missing ExtKeyUsage the certificate chain will not be generated.
The generation will stop after the root certificate was generated.

RESULT:



--- EOF ------------------------------------------------------------------------
