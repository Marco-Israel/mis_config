# OpenSSL Tools
To generate the certificates the OpenSSL toolset is used. The certificates are
described by configuration files located in the folder *openssl_configs* and
are used by OpenSSL tools during certificate build.

## Get started
To get started, simply run the script *./create-certificates.sh*. This will
generate a working example certificate chain in the *output* folder, containing:
* root-ca.der certificate  
* sub-ca.der certificate  
* subscriber certificate  

Type *-h or *--help* to get more information

## Scripts
Besides the *./create-certificates.sh" there are a few helper scripts inside this
folder to make someones work easier.  You can type *-h* or *--help* on each to 
get further information.

### ./create-certificates.sh  
This is a script building the certificates. Run *--help* for further information 

#### Example 
 * Generate  good-case default example:
    ./create-certificates.sh  --verbose

* Generate  certificates and keypairs with modified configuration files
    ./create-certificates.sh <path_openssl_configs/config_folder>/

### ./diff_human_readable.py
This is a *python3* script to get a diff from two human readable 
certificate txt files.  This is useful if you generate certificates from 
modified *openssl_configs*.

#### Example
* Compare to human readable certificates.
      python3 ./diff_human_readable.py <golden-hu.txt> <silver-hu.txt> [--output <path/out.txt>]

How to generate human readable certificates see *./create-certificates.sh --verbose*.
See also *./clone_config.sh* and *./chain_diff_human_readable.sh* in case you like 
to create a modified copy of openssl_configs

### ./chain_diff_human_readable.sh
This is a wrapper to the python script diff_human_readable.py
compares all the silver certificates with the golden ones and stores the
diff in a logfile near this script. Run *--help* to get further information.

### ./clone_config.sh
This is a simple script to create a new independent *openssl_configs* bundle.
Run *--help* for more information.

## OpenSSL man pages
The following man pages are useful when working with openssl and its configuration 
files. 
* man openssl-ecparam 
* man openssl-rq
* man openssl-ca
* man openssl-x509
* man x509v3_config
