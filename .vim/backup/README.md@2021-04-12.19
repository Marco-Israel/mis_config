## General info
This folder holds configuration files used by openssl tool to generate X509
conform certificates. This configuration files are a mix of asn1 syntax
elements and openssl specific syntax elements. You can find more information in
the man pages

## Folder structure
This folder holds a couple of sup folders:
* The folders with a dotted number are test cases.
* The folder golden_certificates holds the default configuration file.
* doc holds some documentation about asn1 or the requirements related to this
    project as also the schemata description files.
* README.md is this file

    |   `-- README                              Description to each testcase  


## Scripts
For each scripts you will get further information by --help   

### ./create-certificates.sh  
This is a script building the certificates. Run --help for further information  

### ./create-test-certificates.sh  
This is a wrapper to ./create-certificates.sh. When first called it sets up the
test folder structure. When called again it will execute the certificate
generation process in the given test case folder. There are some useful
arguments for the script. Run --help for more information.

### ./certificate-compare.sh 
This is a wrapper to the python script ./tools/certdiff/cert_texdiff.py. It
compares all the silver certificates with the golden ones and stores the
diff in a logfile near this script.

## man pages
The following man pages are my useful to work with openssl and its configuration 
files. 
* man openssl-ecparam 
* man openssl-rq
* man openssl-ca
* man openssl-x509
* man x509v3_config
