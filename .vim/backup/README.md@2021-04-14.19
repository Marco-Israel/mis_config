# OpenSSL Tools
To generate the certificates the OpenSSL toolset is used. The certificates are
desciped by configuration files located in the folder *openssel_configs* and
are used by OpenSSL tools during certificate build.

## Get started
To get started simple run the script *./create-certificates.sh*. This will
generate a working example certificate chain in the *output* folder, containing:
* root-ca.der certificate  
* sub-ca.der certificate  
* subscriber certificate  

Type *-h or *--help* to get more information

## Scripts
Beside the *./create-certificates.sh" there are a few helper scripts inside this
folder to make someones work easier.  You can type *-h* or *--help* on each to 
get further information.

### ./create-certificates.sh  
This is a script building the certificates. Run *--help* for further information 

### ./diff_human_readable.py
This is a *python3* script to get the different from two human readable 
certificate txt files.  This is useful if you generate certificates from 
modified *openssel_configs*.

To generate human readable certificates see *./create-certificates.sh --verbose*. 
See also *./clone_config.sh* and *./chain_diff_human_readable.sh* in case you 
like to create a modified copy of openssel_configs

### ./chain_diff_human_readable.sh
This is a wrapper to the python script diff_human_readable.py
compares all the silver certificates with the golden ones and stores the
diff in a logfile near this script. Run *--help* to get further information.

### ./clone_config.sh
This is a simple script to create a new independent *openssel_configs* bundle.
Run *--help* for more information.

## OpenSSL man pages
The following man pages are my useful to work with openssl and its configuration 
files. 
* man openssl-ecparam 
* man openssl-rq
* man openssl-ca
* man openssl-x509
* man x509v3_config
