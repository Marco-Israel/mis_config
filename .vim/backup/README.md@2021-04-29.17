## General info
This folder holds test configuration files used by openssl tool to generate X509
conform certificates with settings are not conform to this project requirements. 
This configuration files are a mix of asn1 syntax elements and openssl 
specific syntax elements. You can find more information in the man pages
mentioned out in the end of this README.md.

To generate the test certificates you need to checkout the ./cert_mgmt
sub module which is need by the script below.

## Scripts
For each scripts you will get further information by --help   

### ./create-test-certificates.sh  
This is a wrapper to ./create-certificates.sh which you can find in the
./cert_mgmt sub module folder. When first called it sets up the
test folder structure. When called again it will execute the certificate
generation process in the given test case folder. There are some useful
arguments for the script. Run --help for more information.


#### Example
```console
    # Generate one single testcase
./create-test-certificates.sh <output_path>/1.2.3.4_requirement/1_test_case -n
```

```console
    # Generate all testcase with human_readables and database verbose output
./create-test-certificates.sh -a -v
```

```console
    # Remove all output folders in all testcases
./create-test-certificates.sh  -r
```

```console
    # Extract (-e) the certificates after generation from the testcase folder
    # into a separated path an folder. The new folder holds the same 
    # folder structure inside# like the corresponding configuration files. 
    # Delete the results afterwards from inside the configuration (-r)
./create-test-certificates.sh  -e new_path/new_foldername -r
```

```console
    # The same like -e with -d but extract (split) the results directly
    # during the generation (of all files) into a separated folder.
./create-test-certificates.sh -a -s
```

### Further scripts
Further scripts can be found in the sub module ./cert_mgmt which can be used
also to handle this test certificates. Run --help for each of it to get further 
information.

## man pages
The following man pages are my useful to work with openssl and its configuration 
files. 
* man openssl-ecparam 
* man openssl-rq
* man openssl-ca
* man openssl-x509
* man x509v3_config
