TEST
"3.2.5.3Ex_extension_SubjectDirectoryAttributes_Attribute_Clearance"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED SCOPE:

1.
Clearance [..]  has set all of the prescribed clearance bits [...] the bitwise
AND must not evaluate to zero.

2.
If certificate i [..] and the attribute Clearance therein, then certificate i-1
MUST either contain the attribute Clearance which covers all classification bits
of certificate i, or must not contain the attribute Clearance at all.

3.
If certificate i-1 contains [...] and the attribute Clearance therein, then
certificate i MUST contain the attribute Clearance, too, and list no more
clearance levels than certificate i-1.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTLIST:

1_different_clearanceBitmask_in_root_and_sub
According to the requirements root shall have at least the higest bits set wich
are also used by the sub certificate. In other words, sub shall not have bits
set which are not set by the root certificate (and also higher ranked)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1_different_clearanceBitmask_in_root_and_sub

EXPECT:
because openssl does not support SubjectKeyIdentifier and does also not support
clearance, the certificates will be generated regardless of the bits. In other
words The bits will not be checked by openssl because it is not supported..

RESULT:
TRUE


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2_clearance_not_implemented_in_root

EXPECT:
The same as 1_different_clearanceBitmask_in_root_and_sub. Openssel does not
support clearance and so it will not care about if it is aviable or not

RESULT:
TRUE
