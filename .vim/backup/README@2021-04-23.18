3.2.2.4_Extension_ExtendedKeyUsage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED SCOPE:
The implementation MUST be modular such that the extension supports proprietary,
custom-defined OIDs in addition to the well-known OIDs.


In addition to 3.2.5.2 Extension ExtKeyUsage:
The absence of the extension represents any key usage.
A lower certificate cannot have more extended key usages than a higher
certificate, only less.

Define different pseudo OIDs in root and sub configuration files; not used
somewhere else.

2_valid_OIDs_but_not_for_this_project.
Use standard OID shortcut name

3_a_lower_certificate_with_more_extended_key_usages
The absence of the extension represents any key usage.  A lower certificate
cannot have more extended key usages than a higher certificate, only less. To
test this, the sub and subsriber certificates will miss the (have no) extended
keyUsage but the root certificate implements a valid ExtKeyUsage extension.
