AuthorityKeyIdentifier needs to be calculated by the software.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1_no_subjectKeyIdentifier_and_authorityKeyIdentifier_in_root

EXPECT:
The generation of certificates should fail after the root certificate was
created. The sub certificate expact the two KeyIdentifiers which are not
available in the root and so the compilation stops in this point.

RESULT
FALSE
The subscriber certificate fails. The sub certificate was generated
This makes not difference if in the root certificate CA=TRUE or CA=FALSE is set.
